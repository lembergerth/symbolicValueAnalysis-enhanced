Skipping recursive function call from ezusb_ctx_complete to ezusb_req_queue_run (CallstackCPA:CallstackTransferRelation.getAbstractSuccessorsForEdge, WARNING)

Infeasible counterexample found, but could not remove it from the ARG. Therefore, we cannot prove safety. (CounterexampleCheckAlgorithm.checkCounterexample, WARNING)
