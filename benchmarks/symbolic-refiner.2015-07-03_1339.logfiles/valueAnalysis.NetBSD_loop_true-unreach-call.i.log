Running CPAchecker with Java heap of size 10000M.
Running CPAchecker with the following extra VM options:  -Djava.io.tmpdir=/tmp/vcloud-vcloud-master/worker/tmp_1792701393_tempdir
Infeasible counterexample found, but could not remove it from the ARG. Therefore, we cannot prove safety. (CounterexampleCheckAlgorithm.checkCounterexample, WARNING)

Shutdown requested (The CPU-time limit of 900s has elapsed.), waiting for termination. (ForceTerminationOnShutdown$1.shutdownRequested, WARNING)

Warning: Analysis stopped (The CPU-time limit of 900s has elapsed.) (ShutdownNotifier.shutdownIfNecessary, WARNING)
