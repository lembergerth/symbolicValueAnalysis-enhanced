Highest possible value reached in score computation. Error path prefix preference may not be applied reliably. (VariableClassification.obtainDomainTypeScoreForVariables, WARNING)

Infeasible counterexample found, but could not remove it from the ARG. Therefore, we cannot prove safety. (CounterexampleCheckAlgorithm.checkCounterexample, WARNING)

Analysis incomplete: no errors found, but not everything could be checked. (CPAchecker.analyzeResult, WARNING)
