Running CPAchecker with Java heap of size 10000M.
Running CPAchecker with the following extra VM options:  -Djava.io.tmpdir=/tmp/vcloud-vcloud-master/worker/tmp_1752135328_tempdir
Inline assembler ignored, analysis is probably unsound! (CFABuilder.createCFA, WARNING)

line 5500: Function pointer *__cil_tmp4 with type void (*)(struct file *, wait_queue_head_t *, struct poll_table_struct *) is called, but no possible target functions were found. (CFunctionPointerResolver.replaceFunctionPointerCall, WARNING)

line 5500: Ignoring call via function pointer poll_wait::__cil_tmp4 for which no suitable target was found in line: (*__cil_tmp4)(filp, wait_address, p); (FunctionPointerCPA:FunctionPointerTransferRelation.getAbstractSuccessorsForEdge, WARNING)

Infeasible counterexample found, but could not remove it from the ARG. Therefore, we cannot prove safety. (CounterexampleCheckAlgorithm.checkCounterexample, WARNING)

Analysis incomplete: no errors found, but not everything could be checked. (CPAchecker.analyzeResult, WARNING)
