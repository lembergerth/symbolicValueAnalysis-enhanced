Inline assembler ignored, analysis is probably unsound! (CFABuilder.createCFA, WARNING)

line 7482: Function pointer *(hdlc->attach) with type int (*)(struct net_device *, unsigned short, unsigned short) is called, but no possible target functions were found. (CFunctionPointerResolver.replaceFunctionPointerCall, WARNING)

Skipping recursive function call from ppp_cp_event to ppp_cp_event (CallstackCPA:CallstackTransferRelation.getAbstractSuccessorsForEdge, WARNING)

Infeasible counterexample found, but could not remove it from the ARG. Therefore, we cannot prove safety. (CounterexampleCheckAlgorithm.checkCounterexample, WARNING)

Shutdown requested (The CPU-time limit of 900s has elapsed.), waiting for termination. (ForceTerminationOnShutdown$1.shutdownRequested, WARNING)
