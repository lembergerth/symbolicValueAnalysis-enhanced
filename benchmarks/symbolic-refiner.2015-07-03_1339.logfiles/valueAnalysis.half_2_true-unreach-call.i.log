Running CPAchecker with Java heap of size 10000M.
Running CPAchecker with the following extra VM options:  -Djava.io.tmpdir=/tmp/vcloud-vcloud-master/worker/tmp_141469711_tempdir
Undefined function assume found, first called in line 13 (CheckBindingVisitor.visit, WARNING)

line 13: Return type of function assume is void, but result is used as type int: assume(n >= 0); (CounterexampleCheck:PredicateCPA:CtoFormulaConverter.getReturnType, WARNING)

Cannot get declaration of function assume, ignoring calls to it. (CounterexampleCheck:PredicateCPA:ExpressionToFormulaVisitor.visit, WARNING)

Infeasible counterexample found, but could not remove it from the ARG. Therefore, we cannot prove safety. (CounterexampleCheckAlgorithm.checkCounterexample, WARNING)

Analysis incomplete: no errors found, but not everything could be checked. (CPAchecker.analyzeResult, WARNING)
