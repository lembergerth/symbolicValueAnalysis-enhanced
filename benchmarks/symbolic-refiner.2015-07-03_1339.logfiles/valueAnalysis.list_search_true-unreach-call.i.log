Running CPAchecker with Java heap of size 10000M.
Running CPAchecker with the following extra VM options:  -Djava.io.tmpdir=/tmp/vcloud-vcloud-master/worker/tmp_-94701437_tempdir
Infeasible counterexample found, but could not remove it from the ARG. Therefore, we cannot prove safety. (CounterexampleCheckAlgorithm.checkCounterexample, WARNING)

Analysis incomplete: no errors found, but not everything could be checked. (CPAchecker.analyzeResult, WARNING)
