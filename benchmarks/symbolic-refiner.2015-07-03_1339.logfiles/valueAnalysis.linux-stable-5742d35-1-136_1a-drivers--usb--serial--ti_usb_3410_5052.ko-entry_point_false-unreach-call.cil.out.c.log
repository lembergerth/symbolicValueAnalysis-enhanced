Running CPAchecker with Java heap of size 10000M.
Running CPAchecker with the following extra VM options:  -Djava.io.tmpdir=/tmp/vcloud-vcloud-master/worker/tmp_1594508872_tempdir
Inline assembler ignored, analysis is probably unsound! (CFABuilder.createCFA, WARNING)

lines 4531-4533: Function pointer *((void (*)(void *, unsigned long, const void *, size_t , size_t , gfp_t ))it_func) with type void (*)(void *, unsigned long, const void *, size_t , size_t , gfp_t ) is called, but no possible target functions were found. (CFunctionPointerResolver.replaceFunctionPointerCall, WARNING)

Infeasible counterexample found, but could not remove it from the ARG. Therefore, we cannot prove safety. (CounterexampleCheckAlgorithm.checkCounterexample, WARNING)

Analysis incomplete: no errors found, but not everything could be checked. (CPAchecker.analyzeResult, WARNING)
