\section{Definitions of newly introduced concepts}

To increase the performance of the \symbolicExecutionCPA, multiple approaches are designed and evaluated.
Symbolic execution suffers from two major issues:
Path explosion due to its high precision and the bad performance of SAT checks.
Since we use off-the-shelf SMT solvers for checking satisfiability we can not influence the performace of SAT checks.
Instead almost all of our approaches focus on decreasing the state space.

We will first look at some optimizations to the existing \symbolicExecutionCPA\ without using CEGAR before adapting this algorithm.
