\section{A different merge operator for \constraintsCPA}
\label{sec:newMerge}
For every operation $\assume(p)$ at a location $l$ that transfers the control flow to a location $l'$ there exists another operation $\assume(\neg p)$ at the same location transfering the control flow to a location $l'' \neq l'$.
In most programs it is probable that the two different program branches starting at $l'$ and $l''$ meet again, that means that for a later program location $l'''$ two abstract states $a, a'$ of the \constraintsCPA\ (in the following  called \emph{constraints states}) exist with $a$ containing $p$ and $a'$ containing $\neg p$.

If a constraint $p$ is part of an abstract state $a$, $p$ is true in all concrete states represented by $a$ (just like a predicate in an abstract state of the \predicateCPA\ \cite{Beyer2008}).
If for one program location $l$ two constraints states $a, a'$ exist with $p \in a$ and $\neg p \in a'$ and $a \setminus \{ p \} = a' \setminus \{ \neg p \}$,
then $a$ represents all concrete states for which $p \logicAnd a \setminus \{ p \}$ is true and $a'$ represents all concrete states for which $\neg p \logicAnd a \setminus \{ p \}$ is true.
At this point, the analysis will never be able to prove a program location as infeasible because of $p$ or $\neg p$.
If $a'$ reaches a program location and computes it as infeasible by using $p$, the abstract state $a$ will compute the same program location as feasible, if it reaches it.
Because of this, it seems legit to delete these obsolete constraints and only continue with one more abstract state instead of two more concrete ones by using the merge operator
\[ \cpaMerge (a, a', \pi) = \begin{dcases}
a' \setminus \neg Q & \text{ if } a \lesserEqual a' \setminus \neg Q \\
a' & \text{ otherwise}
\end{dcases} \]
with $\neg Q = \{\neg p |\ p \in a \logicAnd \neg p \in a' \}$ and $Q = \{ p |\ p \in a \logicAnd \neg p \in a' \}$.
It is not necessary that $a' \setminus \neg Q = a \setminus Q$.
If $a' \setminus \neg Q$ represents a super set of the concrete states represented by $a \setminus Q$, that is $a \setminus Q \lesserEqual a' \setminus \neg Q$, then the above condition is true, and $a \lesserEqual a \setminus Q$.

This condition is automatically checked by the $\mergeAgree$ operator, so we can simply use $\cpaMerge(a, a', \pi) = a' \setminus \neg Q$.
