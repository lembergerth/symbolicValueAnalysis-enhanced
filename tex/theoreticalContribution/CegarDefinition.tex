\subsection{CEGAR for Symbolic Value Analysis + ConstraintsCPA}

For using the \symbolicExecutionCPA\ with CEGAR, we have to define a refinement procedure that returns a precision of type $\Pi_\symExCPA$ that fits the precision of the \symbolicExecutionCPA. We designed two such refinement procedures:
The first uses adjusted versions of the refinement and interpolation algorithms as used for abstract variable assignments,
with an adjusted strongest-post operator and a precision type that fits $\Pi_\symExCPA$.
The second refinement procedure extracts a precision for the \symbolicExecutionCPA\ from the precision created by the refinement of the \predicateCPA, which is based on interpolation in the domain of linear arithmetics.

\subsubsection{Refinement based on refinement for abstract variable assignments}
\label{sec:assignmentRefinement}
We adjust the refinement algorithm for abstract variable assignments (Alg. \ref{alg:refinementExplicit}).
The feasibility check of an error path $\sigma$ is performed by executing the \symbolicExecutionCPA\ with full precision for all program locations $l$.
If the error location of $\sigma$ is reached by the analysis, the path is feasible. It is infeasible, otherwise.

%\paragraph{New strongest post operator (VA-Transfer + ConstraintsPrec transfer + strengthening)}
We use a strongest-post operator that reflects the semantics of our \symbolicExecutionCPA\ by 
defining a composite operator $\strongestPostOpSym_{op} : V_\symValCPA \times 2^\goodconstraintsset \rightarrow V_\symValCPA \times 2^\goodconstraintsset$.
It is the composition of the transfer relations of the \symbolicValueAnalysisCPA\ and the \constraintsCPA, as well as the strengthen operator $\strengthenOp{\constrCPA}{\symValCPA}$ to create useful constraints states.
The result of $\strongestPostOpSym_{op}$ is contradicting if $\strengthenOp{\constrCPA}{\symValCPA}$ is not defined (that means that the conjunction of constraints are contradicting) or the transfer relation of the \symbolicValueAnalysisCPA\ produces a contradicting abstract variable assignment.
Formally:
\[ \strongestPostOpSym_{op} (v, a) = \begin{dcases}
(v', a'') & \parbox{.6\textwidth}{ if $v \gtransfer_\symValCPA v'$,  $a \gtransfer_\constrCPA a'$, $\strengthenOp{\constrCPA}{\symValCPA}(a', v')$ is defined with $\strengthenOp{\constrCPA}{\symValCPA}(a', v') = a''$ and $g = (\cdot, op, \cdot)$}\\
\bot & \text{ otherwise}
\end{dcases}\]
The contradiction $\bot$ represents the bottom element for both the \symbolicValueAnalysisCPA\ as well as for the \constraintsCPA.
Both the transfer relation of the \symbolicValueAnalysisCPA\ $\transfer_\symValCPA$ and the transfer relation of the \constraintsCPA\ $\transfer_\constrCPA$ always produce only one successor, so we can use them in our definition while keeping $\strongestPostOpSym_{op}$ unambigious.
The performance of this strongest-post operator can be significantly worse than when only using abstract variable assignments since SAT checks have to be performed in the strengthen operation.
Because of this, the amount of calls of the strongest-post operator can make a notable difference in performance.

\end{algorithm}

Using this strongest-post operator for interpolation (Alg. \ref{alg:interpolateSym}) allows the computation of an interpolant for a prefix $\prefix$ and a suffix $\suffix$ at a specific program location based on the semantics of the \symbolicExecutionCPA.
Since we want to create an interpolant $\Gamma$ that contains all information necessary for proving that $\strongestPostOpSym_{\Gamma \logicAnd \suffix}$ is contradicting, not only abstract variable assignments but also constraints have to be considered.
First, we compute the strongest-post condition $(v, a)$ for the prefix $\prefix$.
Similar to interpolation for abstract variable assignments, we then eliminate all assignments from $v$ that are not required for proving that $\suffix$ is contradicting.
Next, we remove all constraints from $a$ that are not required. This way we try to get the weakest interpolant possible.
We then build the interpolant from all left assignments of $v$ and all left constraints in $a$.
Contrary to Algorithm \ref{alg:interpolateSym}, we build the interpolant $\Gamma$ not by using $\assume$ operations for each $x \in \defRange(v)$, but assignment operations.
By using $\assume$ operations only for the constraints of $a$ we can easily distinguish between both domains.
It is not wrong to only use $\assume$ operations, but it would unnecessarily increase the precision for the \constraintsCPA and the constraints sets used in the inductive interpolations, as all assumptions are added here.
This could significantly decrease performance during interpolation due to the for-loop over all constraints in Line \ref{alg:interpolateSym:itpAStart} and the strongest-post operators bad performance.
It might even be more effective to just use all constraints and not perform these additional strongest-post computations
by omitting Lines \ref{alg:interpolateSym:aInterpolationBegin} - \ref{alg:interpolateSym:aInterpolationEnd} of the algorithm.
Additionaly, it is also possible to eliminate unnecessary constraints first, and variables second.
We will examine all three possibilities later in detail.

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

After interpolation is done, a precision of type $\Pi_\symExCPA$ must be extracted from this interpolant so that future executions of the CPA algorithm with the \symbolicExecutionCPA\ can prove the examined error path as infeasible.
To get a precision that consists of the two individual precisions of \symbolicValueAnalysisCPA\ and \constraintsCPA\ from an interpolant $\Gamma$, we define the $\extractPrecisionFunc$ function as the composition of two new functions, each of which extracts the precision for one of these CPAs based on $\Gamma$:
\[\extractPrecisionSym{\Gamma} = (\extractPrecisionSymVal{\Gamma}, \extractPrecisionConstr{\Gamma})\]
with
%\begin{align*}
\[\extractPrecisionSymVal{\Gamma} = \{ x |\ (x, z) \in v \text{, } z \neq \bot_\valueset \text{ and } \strongestPostOpSym_\Gamma (\varnothing) = (v, a) \}\]
and
\[\extractPrecisionConstr{\Gamma}  = a \text{ with } \strongestPostOpSym_\Gamma (\varnothing) = (v, a)\]
if the \constraintsCPA\ uses the precision $L \rightarrow 2^\goodconstraintsset$, or
\[\extractPrecisionConstrAlt{\Gamma} = \{ x |\ \exists p \in a : \text{p originates from an expression with $x$} \}\]
if the \constraintsCPA\ uses the precision $L \rightarrow 2^X$.
%\end{align*}
The \symbolicValueAnalysisCPA\ is based on the \valueAnalysisCPA, so it also works with the default refinement procedure for abstract variable assignments described in Section \ref{sec:cegarBasics}.
We simply use the existing $\extractPrecisionFunc$ for this CPA.
The precision of the \constraintsCPA\ is the set of all tracked constraints, so the constraints that result from applying the strongest-post operator to the interpolant provide the precision needed at the current location for proving the current error path as infeasible in future analysis.
The adjusted refinement procedure is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:refineSym1}.

\subsubsection{Refinement based on refinement for \predicateCPA}
Another possible way of refinement is to delegate the procedure to the refinement of the \predicateCPA\ and extract  a precision of type $\Pi_\symExCPA$ from the created predicate precision.
This might not always work as the \predicateCPA\ is able to handle more complex operations than the \symbolicExecutionCPA, for example non-deterministic arrays.
Even if an error path $\sigma$ is infeasible by using the \symbolicExecutionCPA\ with full precision, the interpolant (and resulting precision) computed by the \predicateCPA 's refinement could rely on unsupported operations.

Two other drawbacks exist due to the \predicateCPA's precision type:
In the current implementation of \CpaChecker, we are not able to create constraints out of the predicates of the precision created by the \predicateCPA's refinement, but can only extract program variables' names.
Due to this it is not possible to use the precision type $\Pi_\constrCPA = L \rightarrow 2^\goodconstraintsset$ as part of $\Pi_\symExCPA$, but only $\Pi_\symValCPA$ (see Section \ref{sec:constraintsCPA}).
Secondly, the precision type $\Pi_\predCPA = 2^P$ of the \predicateCPA\ is not location-based per definition. Because of this, we have to assign the same set of tracked program variables for each location.
This is not a problem in the implementation though, because a more detailed adjustment of the \predicateCPA\ is possible there.

Despite these problems this approach might still yield better performance then $\refineSymbolicFunc$.
Though both have to rely on SMT solvers, our own procedure performs one SAT check for every constraint, while the \predicateCPA's refinement utilizes a SMT solver to handle the complete interpolation process, which is presumably more performant due to its specialization.
Algorithm \ref{alg:refineSym2} shows the refinement procedure delegating to \predicateCPA's refinement.
After computing the precision $\pi'$ of the \predicateCPA, the variables used in the predicates of $\pi'$ are extracted and assigned as the precision $\pi_\symValCPA(l)$ for every location $l$. The precision $\pi_\symValCPA$ is then returned as precision for both \symbolicValueAnalysisCPA\ and \constraintsCPA.
