\subsection{Existing options/optimizations}
\subsubsection{Constraints State simplifications}
\paragraph{Computing definite assignments for symbolic values (+ strengthening in value analysis)}
\paragraph{Handling of trivial constraints - completely trivial ones not even added to state, ones with definite assignment removed after SAT check}
\paragraph{Removing outdated constraints - building dependency map and removing ones without dependency}
