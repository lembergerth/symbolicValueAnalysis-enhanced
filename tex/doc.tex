\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
\subsubsection{Why Software Verification is important/needed}
\subsubsection{Basic Value Analysis can't deal with non-deterministic values (+ Example)}
\subsubsection{But symbolic value analysis pretty slow, as previous evaluation has shown (illustrate path explosion, sat checks)}
\subsubsection{Goal: Try to speed up}
\subsection{Our contribution: CEGAR and bounded loops}
