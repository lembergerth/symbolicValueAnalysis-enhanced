\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
\subsection{Existing problems of symbolic value analysis (short overview)}

\section{Theoretical background}
\subsection{General Overview of configurable program analysis}
\subsubsection{Configurable program analysis definition}
\subsubsection{Location CPA as example CPA}
\subsubsection{CPAchecker as a framework for configurable program analysis}

\subsection{Basic definition of CPAs used in this paper}
\subsubsection{Symbolic Value Analysis CPA}
\subsubsection{Constraints CPA}
\subsubsection{Composition of Location CPA, Symbolic Value Analysis CPA and Constraints CPA}

\section{Implementation of these CPAs in CPAchecker}
\subsection{Basic implementation}
\subsubsection{LocationCPA already existed, implemented as defined}
\subsubsection{Symbolic Value Analysis as extension to existing ValueAnalysisCPA}
\subsubsection{ConstraintsCPA as new CPA}
\subsection{Existing options/optimizations}
\subsubsection{Constraints State simplifications}
\paragraph{Computing definite assignments for symbolic values (+ strengthening in value analysis)}
\paragraph{Handling of trivial constraints - completely trivial ones not even added to state, ones with definite assignment removed after sat check}
\paragraph{Removing outdated constraints - building dependency map and removing ones without dependency}
\subsubsection{Different merge operators}
\paragraph{merge sep}
\paragraph{merge join}
\subsubsection{Different less-or-equal operators}

\section{Performance issues of implementation}
\subsection{SAT checks}
\subsection{Path explosion}

\section{CEGAR as general means of speed up}
