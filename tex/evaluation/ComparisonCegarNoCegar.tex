\subsection{Comparison of Symbolic Value Analysis with CEGAR and without CEGAR}
\subsection{Problems CEGAR can't solve/newly creates}
\subsubsection{Many variables needed for proof can decrease performance}
\subsubsection{Problem of long/endless loops and path explosion because of these can't be solved}
